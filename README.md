## Getting started

The recommended Node version matching production is available in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/trollepierre/recontact_travel_blog/blob/dev/.nvmrc).

``` bash
# install Yarn
npm install -g yarn@latest

# get project sources
git clone git@github.com:trollepierre/recontact_travel_blog.git
cd recontact_travel_blog

# install dependencies
yarn

# run tests
yarn test

# build Vue.js  client for production with minification
yarn build

# start the application (run in two terminals)
yarn start:back
yarn start:front
```

You can run the API server independently of the client's development one.

## Push and Skip CI

Skipping pipeline is possible by passing either [ci skip] or [skip ci] tag in the first line of the body of the commit or the commitâ€™s title as documented in [CircleCI docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/skip-build/).

## Release to production

The release to production process is as simple as running the command (from any branch):

```bash
yarn release
```

## PostgreSQL

SQLite is recommended for local development. To fix bug in production, it is better to use PostgreSQL
