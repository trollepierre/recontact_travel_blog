- use colors.scss to set color in all pages :
- allowMultipleClick on < Article 85 > of the header ?


Done:

- extract app button from header
- use app button to manage NuxtLink in header
- fix hover on logo Recontact Me (red over red)
- give names to color
- create color palette
- use colors.scss to set color in AppHeader
- use colors.scss to set color in index.vue (homepage)
- standardize colors to use them in all the pages (except Modal and Admin)

Out-of-story:

- integrate app-button everywhere
- use breakpoint from .scss file
- fix on article 1, no arrow nav
- Darkmode on modals
